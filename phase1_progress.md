# Phase 1 Implementation Progress - DirectX Hooking System

## Current Status Overview
- **Last Updated**: 2023-08-08
- **Project Phase**: Phase 1 - Initial Implementation of DirectX Hooks
- **Current Focus**: DXGI SwapChain Vtable Hook System and Frame Extraction

## What We've Done
- Created the core structure for the DirectX hooking system:
  - Implemented `VTableHook` base class and `SwapChainHook` for hooking DirectX interfaces
  - Created memory scanning functionality to find DirectX modules and signatures
  - Implemented frame extraction from captured back buffers
  - Built shared memory transport for IPC between the injected DLL and external applications
  - Set up assembly-level hook trampolines using virtual table modification
  - Created test client application to demonstrate frame capture
  - Implemented injector script to load DLL into target processes

## What We're Doing Now
- Testing and debugging the SwapChain hook implementation
- Implementing error handling and recovery for frame capture
- Adding COM interface detection with runtime tracking
- Improving the frame extraction pipeline for better performance
- Working on shader analysis for render target identification

## What We'll Do Next
### Immediate Next Steps
- Complete `1.1.2: COM Interface Runtime Detection`
- Implement signature patterns for SwapChain creation functions
- Add version-specific vtable layout detection (D3D11 vs D3D12)
- Enhance error handling in frame extraction pipeline
- Start work on `1.2: Memory Scanning and Protection Pattern Detection`

## Integration with Existing Framework
- The DirectX hook system will eventually be integrated with the existing accessibility-based framework
- Planned approach is to add a new Named Pipe message type for requesting screen captures
- Will expose an API for capturing specific windows or screen regions
- Need to ensure compatibility with the current accessibility controller
